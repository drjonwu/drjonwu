### Hi, I'm Jonathan 👋
**I am a Physician who speaks "Engineer."**

I don't write production code. I build **functional prototypes** to validate clinical logic and safety constraints before engineering teams start building.

**My Architecture Philosophy:**
* **Safety First:** Logic must be deterministic where possible (see `VaxCheck`).
* **Auditability:** Generative AI must cite its sources (see `MedGuide`).
* **Interoperability:** Data schemas must align with FHIR/HL7 standards.

**Core Stacks:**
* **Prototyping:** React, TypeScript, Python
* **AI Ops:** RAG, Vector Embeddings, Chain-of-Thought
* **Domain:** Clinical Informatics, Pharmacovigilance, HEDIS
